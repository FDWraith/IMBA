# Team: Blue Puppies
A small team of moronic programmers trying to make a platform game. 
# Project Name: IMBA
A dungeon exploring game. The main goal is to reach the door at the end in order to pass the level. Along the way, you will encounter various enemies and obstacles that you have to get past. In addition to all these, we will attempt to add a level editor to create your own levels!
